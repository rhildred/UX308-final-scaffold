# UX308-final-scaffold

This is a starting place in stackblitz for the final exam. To challenge the exam:

1. paste the exam questions over top of the practice questions
2. use \* and \_ to pick out the nouns and verbs
3. write tests and make functions in functions.js to answer the questions.
4. write tests and make a section in components.jsx to show the results of the required number of calls to your function from step 3
